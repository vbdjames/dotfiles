Each top-level directory (except `apt/`, `flatpaks/`, and `system/`) is a
**Stow package**. Stow mirrors the directory tree inside each package into `$HOME`,
creating symlinks. So `dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc` becomes `~/.zshrc`.

## Fresh install — step by step

See [RUNBOOK.md](RUNBOOK.md) for the complete step-by-step setup guide.

## Day-to-day usage

### Making a config change

Edit the file directly — because Stow created symlinks, the file you're editing
in `~/.zshrc` **is** the file in `~/dotfiles/zsh/.zshrc`.

```bash
# Edit live
nano ~/.zshrc

# See what changed
cd ~/dotfiles && git diff

# Commit and push
git add -p && git commit -m "zsh: add alias for kubectl" && git push
```

### Adding a system package

```bash
echo "package-name" >> apt/packages.txt
./install.sh --apt
git add apt/packages.txt && git commit -m "apt: add package-name"
```

### Adding a new Flatpak

```bash
echo "com.example.App" >> flatpaks/flatpaks.txt
./install.sh --flatpak
git add flatpaks/flatpaks.txt && git commit -m "flatpaks: add App"
```

### Re-stowing after adding new files

If you add a new config file to a package directory:

```bash
./install.sh --stow
```

### Selective bootstrap steps

```bash
./install.sh --repos     # only set up third-party apt repos
./install.sh --apt       # only install apt packages
./install.sh --flatpak   # only install Flatpaks
./install.sh --devpod    # only install/configure DevPod
./install.sh --claude    # only install Claude Code
```

### Machine-specific overrides

Some settings shouldn't be the same on every machine (work email, local paths, etc.).
These files are sourced by the tracked config but are **not** committed:

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.zshrc.local` | Machine-specific shell config, secrets, work aliases |
| `~/.gitconfig.local` | Override name/email (e.g. work identity) |

---

## Re-running on an existing system

`install.sh` is fully idempotent — safe to re-run anytime:

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles && git pull
./install.sh
```

Stow uses `--restow` so existing symlinks are refreshed. Apt packages already
installed are skipped. Flatpaks already installed are skipped.
